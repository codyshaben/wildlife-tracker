bighorn_sheep = Animal.create(common_name: 'Bighorn Sheep', scientific_name: 'Ovis canadensis', category: 'Mammal', description: "The bighorn sheep is the mammalian symbol of Colorado Parks and Wildlife and Colorado's official animal. Colorado is home to the largest population of the species anywhere. The animals are five to six feet long with a tail three to six inches in length. Rams weigh 150-250 pounds, ewes 120-200. Males are about three feet high at the shoulder, ewes slightly less. Color is usually grayish brown, with a paler belly and a white rump patch. The massive, coiled horns of mature rams may make up to 10 percent of the body weight. Ewes have spike-like horns. Brooming is the term used to describe the chipping and fraying of horns, usually caused by fighting. Some brooming may be caused by accidents or digging. Rams achieve full curl at about seven or eight years of age. Usually, bighorn sheep are diurnal, being active during daylight and exhibit little nocturnal (nighttime) activity. Adult rams stay segregated from ewes, except during the rut. Young rams join bands of rams when they are two to three years old. Rams battle each other, cracking horns, to test dominance within the herd. Hunting bighorns is carefully regulated. Parasitic disease is common in bighorns. Coyotes, mountain lions and eagles prey on them, and some bighorns succumb to accidental falls.​", approachable: "Remember, at a distance, sheep often appear smaller than viewers expect. Wild sheep are wary of people on foot, especially of someone between them and their uphill escape route. They are often more tolerant of vehicles, so consider using your car as a viewing blind.

Otters are longer, but wolverines are the heaviest of weasels, tipping the scale at 20 to 30 pounds or more. They are stocky mammals, built like a small bear. Their fur is dark brown to black, and the sides have a characteristic yellowish brown to whitish stripe. Like other weasels, wolverine have anal musk-producing glands.', approachable: 'Wolverines are generally not aggressive towards humans, preferring to avoid any human contact.

Read the lynx success press release and view a detailed summary of the program off the lynx research page.The lynx is a large, bob-tailed cat, three feet long with a black-tipped tail only about one-eighth the total length, and only about half the length of its huge hind foot. Weights are 20 – 30 pounds. The coat is grayish, with obscure spots. The magnificent ear tufts may be nearly as long as the actual ears.The lynx lives in North America and Eurasia. Lynx may have disappeared from Colorado by about 1973. Sightings prior to that time were few, scattered throughout mountainous areas of the state. In 1999 an ambitious program of lynx restoration began in the remote San Juan Mountains, and by 2005 more than 200 animals had been released. A number of Lynx paw prints where seen in the snow. Litters of kittens had been born, and lynx were expanding throughout the high country and occasionally beyond.The lynx is found in dense subalpine forest and willow-choked corridors along mountain streams and avalanche chutes, the home of its favored prey species, the snowshoe hare. The typical hunting strategy is patience, stalking prey or crouching in wait beside a trail. Often the surprised quarry is overtaken and dispatched in a single, furious bound. Lynx also eat some carrion, and capture ground-dwelling birds (like grouse) and small mammals. Lynx are active throughout the year; their huge hind feet help them move across heavy snow.', approachable: "Never approach the animal, especially if it's near a kill or with young. Try to appear as big as you can and do not run, turn your back, or take your eyes of the animal.

moose = Animal.create(common_name: 'Moose', scientific_name: 'Alces alces', category: 'Mammal', description: 'Moose have wandered into Colorado occasionally, but there was no breeding population until animals were introduced to North Park from Utah and Wyoming in 1978 and 1979. Populations have expanded to nearby counties (and Rocky Mountain National Park), and animals have been transplanted to the Upper Rio Grande drainage, Grand Mesa, and the Flat Tops Wilderness. Individual moose may also wander widely from their usual mountain haunts, to the edge of the plains, for example, where they sometimes graze alongside cattle. Their body is covered with black or very dark brown hair. They have a very large head with a dewlap of skin, called a “bell,” hanging down from the jaw. Moose have very long legs so they can wade into a lake and eat plants off the bottom. Their legs enable them to paw through deep snow to reach food in winter. Moose are the largest deer; bulls range to 9 1⁄2 feet long (of which only four inches is tail), six feet tall at the shoulder, with weights to over 1,000 pounds. Antlers are “palmate”— flattened like a hand. Antlers of bulls in their prime may weigh over 50 pounds. Antler growth begins late winter with the formation of soft “velvet,” the blood-rich skin that nourishes antler growth. Velvet is rubbed off in fall in preparation for the breeding season. Moose are mainly found as singles or in small groups, not in large herds.', approachable: "Do not approach Moose, although they don't look threatening, they can become aggressive when disturbed.

Coyotes may live up 20 years, but ten years is a rough average. In an extermination effort from 1915 to 1947, bounties were paid on 1,884,897 coyotes in the United States.

Marmots can be waddling fat in the fall, and their long fur makes them look even fatter. Adults are about 26 inches long and weigh up to about 11 pounds. Predators include the coyote, badger, bobcat, golden eagle, hawks, owls, weasels and marten. However, predation probably is a less important cause of mortality than is the stress of hibernation.

The young (juveniles) lack the spotted chest and have few spots on their backs and they have a dark neck collar. Both the adult male and female are the same size. A bobbing, or deep knee bend, often seen in disturbed birds, is distinctive to this owl species. It is most likely the only owl you will see during the day perched a fence post or on the ground in open habitats (grasslands, desert and agricultural areas).

Although burrowing owls can dig their own burrows, they usually occupy burrows that have been dug by other small mammals such as prairie dogs, ground squirrels, and even badgers." , approachable: "View from a distance and respect their habitat. Federal and state laws prohibit the harming or killing of burrowing owls and the destruction of active nests. It is quite possible to inadvertently kill burrowing owls during prairie dog poisoning projects, removal of prairie dogs, destruction of burrows and prairie dogs using a concussive device, or during earth moving for construction. Because burrowing owls often hide in burrows when alarmed, it is not practical to haze the birds away from prairie dog towns prior to prairie dog poisoning/removal, burrow destruction, or construction activity.
